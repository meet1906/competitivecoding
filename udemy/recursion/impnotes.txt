RECURSION

Func which calls itself
Bulb and rubberband example

void func()
{
	statement 1 ---> this will be execeuted at calling time. (before - calling time)
	func()
	statement 2 ----> this will be execeuted at return time. (after - return time)
}

recursion vs loops
difference -> loops will only have ascending phase but recursion will have both ascending and descending phase.

How recursion uses stack?
Total calls -> n+1
Total memory consumption - O(N)
