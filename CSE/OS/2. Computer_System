                ############ CLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTER BASED ON No. of GENERAL PURPOSE PROCESSORS ####################

1. Single Processor System : 1 main CPU capable of executing a general purpose instruction set including instructions from CPU Processes.
                             So only one process can be executed at a time and then the process is selected from the ready queue.  

2. Multi  Processor System : 2 or more Processors in close communication sharing the bus,memory and peripheral devices .
                             ADVANTAGES : 
                                         * Increased Throughput
                                         * Economy of scale
                                         * Increased Reliablity

                            ## MULTICORE PROCESSOR :
                               * Instead of multiple single cores include multiple computer cores on a single chip.
                               * More effecient than multiple single core systems.
                               * 1 chip with multi core uses less power .
                                 EG : Dual-core systems.

3. Clustered Systems :  Like multiprocessor systems, but multiple systems working together , Usually sharing storage and linked via a LAN
                        Provides a high-availability service which survives failures
                        Scalable,it's easy to add new nodes to the system.

                        * Asymmetric clustering has one machine in hot-standby mode and others running applications.
                                Hot standby node monitors the active server. 
                                If that server fails, the hot-standby host becomes the active server.
                        * Symmetric clustering has multiple nodes running applications, monitoring each other       


                ############# MULTI PROCESSOR SYSTEM V/S CLUSTERED SYSTEM ###############

* Multiprocessor systems are single computers which have multiple CPUs.
* Clusters are groups of computers which work together to accomplish some specific work.
* Multiprocessor systems are a lot faster because work communication / coordination is handled by cache memory, and at worst RAM.
* Clustered computers are slower, they have to communicate / coordinate via network.
  But they can handle much larger problems. And they can be setup to have redundancy so that one cluster member failing will only slow down work, not halt it.


           ############### TYPE OF MULTIPROCESSOR SYSTEM ######################

1. Symmetric Multiprocessing : All the processors are peers.
                               All the processros are involved in all tasks. 
                               All the processors share common memory.

2.Asymmetric Multiprocessing : Master - Slave Relationship.
                               1 processor acts as master and monitors others and assigns tasks for them . 
                               Slaves takes care of processes and each processor is responsible for 1 task unlike Symmetric Multiprocessing .


        ############## MULTIPROGRAMMING V/S MULTIPROCESSING V/S MULTITASKING V/S MULTITHREADING ############################

* Multiprogramming : Multiprogramming is also the ability of an operating system to execute more than one program on a single processor machine.
                     More than one task/program/job/process can reside into the main memory at one point of time.
                     When the running process has to wait (for I/O for example), OS switches to another job .

* Multiprocessing  : Multiprocessing is the ability of an operating system to execute more than one process simultaneously on a multi processor machine.
                     In this, a computer uses more than one CPU at a time.   

* Multitasking     : Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between them.  

* Multithreading   : Multithreading is a conceptual programming paradigm where a process is divided into a number of sub-processes called as threads.
                     Each thread is independent and has its own path of execution with enabled inter thread communication.
                     Thread is the path followed while executing a program. Each thread has its own program counter, stack and register."
                     A thread is a light weight process.

                                        ####################### DUAL-MODE OF OS ######################

To ensure proper execution of OS, we must be able to distinguish between execution of OS code and user code.
Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and other system components
** User mode 
** Kernel mode(Supervisor mode/System mode/Privileged mode) 

###### Mode bit
A bit added to the computer hardware to indicate the current mode.
Kernel(0) and user(1) 
Provides ability to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code.

Some instructions designated as privileged, only executable in kernel mode
Eg: I/O control, interrupt management etc



                                    ################ PROCESS v/s PROGRAM v/s THREAD #######################

* PROGRAM : It is a set of instructions designed to complete a specific task.
            Passive entity as it resides in the secondary memory.
            Static entity.No resource requirement other than storage space.

* PROCESS : Process is a program in execution.
            It is an active entity as it's created during execution and loaded into the main memory .
            Dynamic entity.Resource requirement like CPU,I/O during it's lifetime.

* THREAD  : Thread is an execution unit which consists of its own program counter, a stack, and a set of registers. 
            Threads are also known as Lightweight processes.
