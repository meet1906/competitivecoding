                                ################# REGULAR EXPRESSION IN MYSQL ########################

You have seen MySQL pattern matching with LIKE ...%. MySQL supports another type of pattern matching operation based on the regular expressions and the REGEXP operator.
It is very simple  to understand because this matching is same like those scripting the regular expressions (PHP,Perl).

Following is the table of pattern, which can be used along with the REGEXP operator.

#### Pattern	What the pattern matches

^	            Beginning of string
$	            End of string
.       	    Any single character
[...]	        Any character listed between the square brackets
[^...]	        Any character not listed between the square brackets
p1|p2|p3	    Alternation; matches any of the patterns p1, p2, or p3
*	            Zero or more instances of preceding element
+	            One or more instances of preceding element
{n}	n           instances of preceding element
{m,n}	        m through n instances of preceding element



### Examples

Now based on above table, you can device various type of SQL queries to meet your requirements. Here, I am listing a few for your understanding.

Consider we have a table called person_tbl and it is having a field called name −

# Query to find all the names starting with 'st' −

    mysql> SELECT name FROM person_tbl WHERE name REGEXP '^st';

# Query to find all the names ending with 'ok' −

    mysql> SELECT name FROM person_tbl WHERE name REGEXP 'ok$';

# Query to find all the names, which contain 'mar' −

    mysql> SELECT name FROM person_tbl WHERE name REGEXP 'mar';

# Query to find all the names starting with a vowel and ending with 'ok' −

    mysql> SELECT FirstName FROM intque.person_tbl WHERE FirstName REGEXP '^[aeiou].*ok$';


#  Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

mysql> select distinct CITY from STATION
       where CITY regexp '[a,e,i,o,u]$';
