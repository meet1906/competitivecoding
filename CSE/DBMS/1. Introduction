                                    ############ INTRODUCTION ##############

1. Database: Database is a collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from database 
             and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports etc.

2. Database Management System(DBMS) : The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS).
                                      DBMS is a software tool to organize(create, retrieve, update, and delete) data in a database.

                                    ########## ADVANTAGE OF DBMS #############

A. Data independence: Application programs should be as free or independent as possible from details of data representation and storage.
                      DBMS can supply an abstract view of the data for insulating application code from such facts.

B. Efficient data access: DBMS utilizes a mixture of sophisticated concepts and techniques for storing and retrieving data competently.
                          This feature becomes important in cases where the data is stored on external storage devices.

C. Data integrity and security: If data is accessed through the DBMS, the DBMS can enforce integrity constraints on the data.

D. Data administration: When several users share the data, integrating the administration of data can offer significant improvements.
                        Responsible for organizing the data representation to reduce redundancy and make the data to retrieve efficiently.

E. Concurrent access to data: Data can be accessed concurrently by different users at same time in DBMS.

F. Backup and Recovery mechanism: DBMS backup and recovery mechanism helps to avoid data loss and data inconsistency in case of catastrophic failures.

G. Multiple data views: Different views of same data can be created for different users. For Example, faculty salary information can be hidden from student view of data but shown in admin view.


                            ############ DBMS Architecture 2-Level, 3-Level  ###################
                            
* Two tier architecture:

Two tier architecture is similar to a basic client-server model. The application at the client end directly communicates with the database at the server side.
APIâ€™s like ODBC,JDBC are used for this interaction. The server side is responsible for providing query processing and transaction management functionalities.

On the client side, the user interfaces and application programs are run. The application on the client side establishes a connection with the server side in order to communicate with the DBMS.
An advantage of this type is that maintenance and understanding is easier, compatible with existing systems. However this model gives poor performance when there are a large number of users.




* Three Tier architecture:

In this type, there is another layer between the client and the server. The client does not directly communicate with the server.
Instead, it interacts with an application server which further communicates with the database system and then the query processing and transaction management takes place.
This intermediate layer acts as a medium for exchange of partially processed data between server and client. This type of architecture is used in case of large web applications.

## Advantages:

*Enhanced scalability due to distributed deployment of application servers. Now,individual connections need not be made between client and server.
*Data Integrity is maintained. Since there is a middle layer between client and server, data corruption can be avoided/removed.
*Security is improved. This type of model prevents direct interaction of the client with the server thereby reducing access to unauthorized data.

## Disadvantages:

* Increased complexity of implementation and communication. It becomes difficult for this sort of interaction to take place due to presence of middle layers.
