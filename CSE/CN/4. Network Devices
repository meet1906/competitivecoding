                                            ################### NETWORK DEVICES  ############################

1. Repeater – It regenerates the signal over the same network before it becomes too weak or corrupted 
              so as to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same network. 
              An important point to be noted about repeaters is that they do not amplify the signal. When the signal becomes weak, they copy the signal bit by bit and regenerate it at the original strength. 
              It is a 2 port device.
              It works at Physical Layer (Layer 1)
             
 

2. Hub –  A hub is basically a multiport repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations.
          Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.  In other words, collision domain of all hosts connected through Hub remains one.  
          Also, they do not have intelligence to find out best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage.
          A Hudb operates at the Physical layer (Layer 1)

    Types of Hub

    ** Active Hub:-  These are the hubs which have their own power supply and can clean, boost and relay the signal along with the network.
                     It serves both as a repeater as well as wiring centre. These are used to extend the maximum distance between nodes.
    ** Passive Hub:- These are the hubs which collect wiring from nodes and power supply from active hub.
                     These hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can’t be used to extend the distance between nodes.


3. Bridge - It is a device that divides a network into segments. Each segment represent a separate collision domain, so the number of collisions on the network is reduced.
            Each collision domain has its own separate bandwidth, so a bridge also improves the network performance.
            It is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of source and destination.
            If the bridge determines that the destination host is on another segment of the network, it forwards the frame to that segment.
            A bridge works at the Data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. 

4. Switch – A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance.
            The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data,that makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward packets selectively to correct port only.
            In other words, switch divides collision domain of hosts, but broadcast domain remains same.
            Switch main objective is to connect various devices in a network.
            A switch is a Data link layer device. (Layer 2)

5. Router - It is a network device that connects different computer networks by routing packets from one network to the other. This device is usually connected to two or more different networks.
            When a data packet comes to a router port, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine out which port the packet will be sent.
            It has a dynamically updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets.
            For example, a router provides you with the internet access by connecting your LAN with the Internet.
            Router main objective is to connect various networks.

            If two hosts from different networks want to communicate with each other, they will need a router between them.
            A router is considered a Layer 3 device of the OSI model because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information of the OSI Layer 3 (the destination IP address).
