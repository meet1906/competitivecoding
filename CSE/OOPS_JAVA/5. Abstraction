                                    ############ Abstraction ############
                                    
Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.
The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.

An abstraction is an act of representing essential features without including background details.



In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.


Abstract classes and Abstract methods :

A. An abstract class is a class that is declared with abstract keyword.
B. An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.
C. An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
D. A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass,thus making overriding compulsory OR either make subclass itself abstract.
E. Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with abstract keyword.
F. There can be no object of an abstract class.That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the new operator.
G. An abstract class can have parametrized constructors and default constructor is always present in an abstract class.

                    ######### Encapsulation vs Data Abstraction ##############

Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detail hiding(implementation hiding).
While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deals with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.

                    ############ Advantages of Abstraction ##################

It reduces the complexity of viewing the things.
Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.
