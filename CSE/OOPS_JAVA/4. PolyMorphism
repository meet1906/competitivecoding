Polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, object or function to take on multiple forms.
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

$$ In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

A. Compile time Polymorphism
B. Runtime Polymorphism

######### Compile time polymorphism: 
    It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

Method Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.
                    Functions can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.

Operator Overloading: Java also provide option to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’) for string class to concatenate two strings.
                      We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add two operands.
                      So a single operator ‘+’ when placed between integer operands, adds them and when placed between string operands, concatenates them.
                      
In java, Only “+” operator can be overloaded:

To add integers
To concatenate strings


Runtime polymorphism: It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime.
                      This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.

Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.

Example:

// Java program for Method overridding 
  
class Parent { 
  
    void Print() 
    { 
        System.out.println("parent class"); 
    } 
} 
  
class subclass1 extends Parent { 
  
    void Print() 
    { 
        System.out.println("subclass1"); 
    } 
} 
  
class subclass2 extends Parent { 
  
    void Print() 
    { 
        System.out.println("subclass2"); 
    } 
} 
  
class TestPolymorphism3 { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
  
        Parent a; 
  
        a = new subclass1(); 
        a.Print(); 
  
        a = new subclass2(); 
        a.Print(); 
    } 
} 
Output:
subclass1
subclass2

A. Two or more methods having the same name but different parameters or signature	Child class redefining methods present in the base class with the same parameters/ signature
B. Resolved during compile-time                                                     Resolved during runtime
