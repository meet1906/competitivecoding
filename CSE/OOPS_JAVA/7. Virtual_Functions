                ############### Virtual Function in C++ ###################

A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.
When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class’s version of the function.

* Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
* They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism
* Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in base class.
* The resolving of function call is done at Run-time.

                ############# Rules for Virtual Functions #################

*Virtual functions cannot be static and also cannot be a friend function of another class.

*Virtual functions should be accessed using pointer or reference of base class type to achieve run time polymorphism.

*The prototype of virtual functions should be same in base as well as derived class.

*They are always defined in base class and overridden in derived class.
 It is not mandatory for derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case base class version of function is used.

*A class may have virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.


// CPP program to illustrate concept of Virtual Functions 

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

class base { 
public: 
	virtual void print() 
	{ 
		cout << "print base class" << endl; 
	} 

	void show() 
	{ 
		cout << "show base class" << endl; 
	} 
}; 

class derived : public base { 
public: 
	void print() 
	{ 
		cout << "print derived class" << endl; 
	} 

	void show() 
	{ 
		cout << "show derived class" << endl; 
	} 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
	base* bptr; 
	derived d; 
	bptr = &d; 

	// virtual function, binded at runtime 
	bptr->print(); 

	// Non-virtual function, binded at compile time 
	bptr->show(); 
} 


Output:

print derived class
show base class




        ################ VIRTUAL FUNCTION IN JAVA ###################

In Java there is no keyword names “virtual“.

Definition of Virtual from wiki:

In OOP,  virtual function(method) is a function whose behaviour can be overridden within an inheriting class by a function with the same signature to provide the polymorphic behavior.

Therefore according to definition, every non-static method in JAVA is by default virtual method except final and private methods.
The methods which cannot be inherited for polymorphic behavior is not a virtual method.
